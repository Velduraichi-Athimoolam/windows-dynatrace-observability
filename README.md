# windows-dynatrace-observability
This project demonstrates how I enabled log monitoring and observability for Windows-based Kubernetes pods using Dynatrace OneAgent, overcoming the limitation of Linux-only Dynatrace Operator support. By installing OneAgent at the OS level during Windows node bootstrap, I achieved end-to-end visibility for Windows workloads running in Kubernetes.
